# etch-sketch
The etch-a-sketch project created during the Odin project to practice the use of flexbox, html, javascript, and DOM manipulation together.
See Odin Project source here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch 

This project makes extensive use of flexbox css to create a grid with individual row pixels which can be modified in various ways.
Some of what I used in working on this project: 
manipulating flexbox displays on a webpage;
assigning dynamic events using javascript event listeners for button clicks and mouse hovers;
accessing and modifying an rgb value dynamically on a webpage, and more.
